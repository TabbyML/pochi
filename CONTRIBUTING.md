## How to Contribute

### Feature Requests and Bug Reports

To report a bug or request a feature, the preferred method is to use the `/create-issue` command within the Pochi VS Code extension. This command utilizes a workflow defined in this repository to provide richer context, which helps us resolve issues faster.

### Development Workflow

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```
2.  **Launch the development environment:**
    Open the `Run and Debug` panel in VS Code and run the `Run VSCode Extension` task. This will open a new VS Code window with the extension loaded and ready for development.
