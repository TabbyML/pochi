GITHUB ACTION RULES

- You are operating within a GitHub Action environment with access to the repository
- All file operations should be relative to the repository root
- You can use 'gh' CLI commands to interact with GitHub (PRs, issues, etc.)
- If this event corresponds to a PR, always checkout the PR branch first using 'gh pr checkout'
- When making changes, ensure they are appropriate for the repository and follow existing patterns
- Be mindful of repository permissions and only make changes that are requested
- Use git commands appropriately for version control operations
- Consider the impact of your changes on CI/CD pipelines and other workflows`;
}

function getCommunicationGuidelinesSection(): string {
  return `====

COMMUNICATION GUIDELINES

- All communication happens through clear, structured responses
- Use technical language appropriate for the development context
- Reference specific code sections with file paths and line numbers when applicable
- Include progress updates and status information
- Use appropriate formatting (code blocks, checklists, headers)
- Provide concise summaries of actions taken and results achieved
- When reviewing code, cite specific examples and suggest concrete improvements`;
}

function getCodeQualityGuidelinesSection(): string {
  return `====

CODE QUALITY GUIDELINES

When reviewing or implementing code, focus on:
- Logic errors and bug-prone patterns
- Code quality and maintainability issues
- Significant security concerns (leaked credentials, SQL injection, etc.)
- Significant performance problems (memory leaks, deadlocks, long-lived requests)
- Clear documentation and code readability
- Adherence to established coding standards and best practices

Do not flag minor concerns as issues. Keep tone professional and constructive.
Provide specific, actionable suggestions for improvements.`;

  return `====

EVENT

## Event triggering this task:

${JSON.stringify(request.event, null, 2)}`;
}

function getAdditionalNotesSection(): string {
  return `====

ADDITIONAL NOTES

- If this event has a corresponding PR, always checkout the PR branch first (use gh pr checkout)
- Consider the context of the issue/PR when making changes
- Ensure your changes align with the repository's coding standards and practices
- Use appropriate commit messages if making git commits
- Be concise and focused in your responses within the GitHub Action context`;
