# Share

The **Share** feature in Pochi's toolbar allows you to share your current development context with others.

<Callout type="info" title="Public Access">
  Shared conversations are publicly accessible to anyone with the link. Do not share sensitive information or private code.
</Callout>

<div align="center">
![Task Sharing](../assets/images/task-sharing.png)
</div>

### How it works

When you share a conversation, Pochi:
1. Persist your task to our servers, and create a unique public URL for the task..
2. Makes task accessible via a link - `app.getpochi.com/share/<shareId>`
