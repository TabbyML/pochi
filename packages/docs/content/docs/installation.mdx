# **Installation**

You can get started with Pochi by installing Pochi's VSCode extension.

### **1. Install the VSCode Extension**

Install the Pochi extension from the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabbyML.pochi).

1. Open the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`).
2. Search for `Pochi` and click **Install**.

Once installed, the Pochi icon will appear in your Activity Bar.

### **2. Configure an LLM Endpoint (BYOK)**

Pochi operates as an AI agent and requires a connection to a Large Language Model (LLM). The primary way to configure this is through the **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** model. This approach gives you full control over model choice, costs, and data privacy.

To connect your LLM provider:

1. Navigate to VSCode Settings (`Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,`).
2. Go to `Extensions > Pochi`.
3. Enter your API key and select your model provider.

No account is necessary to use Pochi with BYOK.


### **3. Assign a Task**

Once the extension is configured, you can assign tasks to the agent. Open the Pochi chat window and describe the task in detail.

For example:
```
Refactor the `ApiService` class in `src/lib/api.ts` to use `axios` instead of `fetch`. Ensure all existing method signatures are preserved and update error handling to use axios-specific error objects.
```

### **Account-Based Features (Optional)**

For teams needing collaborative tools or centralized billing, we offer optional cloud-based services. Creating a Pochi account gives you access to:

- Pochi's managed LLM models.
- Shared task histories and team management.
- Integrations with GitHub and Slack for a collaborative workflow.

To use these features, sign up at [app.getpochi.com](http://app.getpochi.com) and connect your GitHub account in your profile settings.
