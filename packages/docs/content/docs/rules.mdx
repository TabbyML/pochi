# **Rules**

**Rules** tell Pochi about your project's preferences, coding standards, and constraints. It's like giving Pochi a style guide for your codebase.
You can edit your Rule in Pochi Extension Settings page.

### Setting up Workspace Rules

Create `README.pochi.md` in your project root:

- **Linting**: ESLint + Prettier for frontend, Clippy for Rust
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Coding Standards

### Rust Backend

- Use `snake_case` for variables, functions, and modules
- Use `PascalCase` for structs, enums, and traits
- Prefer `async/await` over manual Future implementations
- Use `anyhow::Result` for error handling in applications
- Use `thiserror` for library error types
- Always add proper error context with `.context()`
- Use `tracing` for logging, not `println!` or `eprintln!`
- Prefer `tokio::spawn` for background tasks
- Use `serde` for serialization with proper derives

### Frontend (TypeScript/React)

- Use `camelCase` for variables and functions
- Use `PascalCase` for components, interfaces, and types
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use TypeScript strict mode - always add proper types
- Use `const` over `let` when possible
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Use Tailwind CSS classes, frontavoid custom CSS when possible
- Use Radix UI components for consistent design
- Always handle loading and error states in components

### File Organization

- **Rust crates**: `/crates/` for open source, `/ee/` for enterprise features
- **Frontend pages**: `/ee/tabby-ui/app/` (Next.js App Router)
- **Frontend components**: `/ee/tabby-ui/components/`
- **Shared utilities**: `/ee/tabby-ui/lib/`
- **GraphQL schemas**: `/ee/tabby-schema/`
- **Database**: `/ee/tabby-db/`

## Testing Guidelines

### Rust Testing

- Write unit tests in the same file using `#[cfg(test)]`
- Use `#[tokio::test]` for async tests
- Use `serial_test` for tests that can't run in parallel
- Skip golden tests during development: `cargo test -- --skip golden`
- Use `temp_testdir` for filesystem tests
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

### Frontend Testing

- Use Vitest for unit and integration tests
- Test files should end with `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx`
- Focus on testing user interactions and business logic
- Use React Testing Library patterns
- Mock GraphQL queries with URQL test utilities

## Development Commands

### Backend Development

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Run with GPU support (choose one)
cargo run --features cuda serve --model TabbyML/StarCoder-1B --device cuda
cargo run --features rocm serve --model TabbyML/StarCoder-1B --device rocm
cargo run serve --model TabbyML/StarCoder-1B --device metal

# Run tests (skip slow golden tests)
cargo test -- --skip golden

# Run specific crate tests
cargo test -p tabby-inference
```

### Frontend Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Lint and format
pnpm lint
pnpm lint:fix

# Generate GraphQL types
pnpm codegen
```

### Monorepo Commands

```bash
# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Lint all packages
pnpm lint
```

## API & GraphQL Guidelines

### GraphQL Schema

- Use descriptive field names and types
- Add proper documentation to all fields
- Use proper GraphQL scalars (DateTime, URL, etc.)
- Implement proper error handling
- Use DataLoader pattern for N+1 query prevention

### REST API

- Follow OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Implement proper error responses
- Add request/response validation
- Use consistent naming conventions

## Database Guidelines

### Migrations

- Always create reversible migrations
- Use descriptive migration names with timestamps
- Test migrations on sample data
- Add proper indexes for query performance
- Use transactions for multi-step migrations

### Queries

- Use prepared statements via SQLx
- Add proper error handling for database operations
- Use connection pooling appropriately
- Implement proper pagination for large datasets

## Security Guidelines

### Authentication & Authorization

- Always validate JWT tokens properly
- Implement proper RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- Use secure session management
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement rate limiting for APIs

### Data Protection

- Never log sensitive information
- Use proper encryption for sensitive data
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Validate file uploads thoroughly
- Use HTTPS in production

## Performance Guidelines

### Backend Performance

- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Implement proper connection pooling
- Use background jobs for heavy operations
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Monitor memory usage in long-running processes

### Frontend Performance

- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper code splitting
- Optimize bundle size with tree shaking
- Use SWR for efficient data fetching
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists

## AI/ML Specific Guidelines

### Model Integration

- Support multiple inference backends (CUDA, ROCm, Metal, CPU)
- Implement proper model loading and unloading
- Handle model inference errors gracefully
- Use proper tokenization for different models
- Implement model switching without restart

### Code Completion

- Respect user privacy - no data collection without consent
- Implement proper context window management
- Use efficient caching for completions
- Handle streaming responses properly
- Implement proper fallback mechanisms

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add rustdoc comments for all public APIs
- Use TSDoc comments for TypeScript functions
- Include examples in documentation
- Document complex algorithms and business logic
- Keep README files up to date

### API Documentation

- Maintain OpenAPI specifications
- Document GraphQL schema thoroughly
- Provide integration examples
- Keep changelog updated
- Document breaking changes clearly

## Don't Do

### General

- Don't commit secrets or API keys
- Don't use `unwrap()` in production Rust code
- Don't use `any` type in TypeScript
- Don't skip error handling
- Don't commit without running tests
- Don't use `console.log` in production frontend code

### Performance

- Don't block the main thread with heavy computations
- Don't make unnecessary database queries
- Don't load entire datasets without pagination
- Don't use synchronous I/O in async contexts

### Security

- Don't trust user input without validation
- Don't expose internal error details to users
- Don't use weak authentication mechanisms
- Don't store passwords in plain text
- Don't ignore security warnings from dependencies

## Deployment

### Production Requirements

- Use proper environment variables for configuration
- Implement health checks for all services
- Use proper logging and monitoring
- Implement graceful shutdown handling
- Use container orchestration for scaling

### Docker

- Use multi-stage builds for smaller images
- Run as non-root user in containers
- Use proper resource limits
- Implement proper signal handling
- Use official base images when possible

### Import Existing Rules

Pochi can import rules from other tools by automatically detecting `.cursorrules` files and importing rules from `.cursor/rules/` directories.
These rules are then converted and merged with your Pochi rules.
For team standards, you can share a `README.pochi.md` file across team repositories to version control your rules and workflows, ensuring consistent coding standards across projects.

### How Pochi uses your rules

On every request, Pochi reads your rules before starting work, automatically following your coding standards and respecting your file organization preferences.
This ensures that all generated code, tests, and documentation adhere to your standards for consistent output.

<Callout title="Getting Started">
  Try a simple `README.pochi.md` file listing your main technologies and basic preferences. You can always add more rules as you discover what works best.
