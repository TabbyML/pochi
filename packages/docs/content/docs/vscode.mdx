# VS Code

This page covers the core Pochi experience in VS Code, from installation and setup to the main chat and task management features.

## Installation

Install the Pochi extension from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabbyML.pochi) or [OpenVSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/TabbyML/pochi).

For the best experience, we recommend dragging the Pochi view to the right sidebar to use it side-by-side with your editor.

## Welcome

Upon first launch, Pochi's Welcome page offers two ways to get started:

- **Sign in to Pochi:** Click "Sign In" and authorize in your browser to use Pochi subscriptions, models, and cloud features.
- **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK):** Use your own models by running `Pochi: Open Custom Model Settings` from the Command Palette. This opens `~/.pochi/config.jsonc` for you to add API keys. See [Models](/models) for details.

## Chat

Access the Pochi chat panel via the Activity Bar icon or shortcut (macOS: `Cmd+L`, Win/Linux: `Ctrl+L`). This is your main interface for interacting with Pochi. **Note:** An active workspace (i.e., an open folder) is required to use the chat.

The panel's title bar includes actions for starting a new task and viewing all tasks.

## Prompting

The input box, located below the chat history, is where you'll compose your messages and control the chat.

- **Auto-Approve Menu:** This menu at the top of the zone allows you to grant Pochi permission to use tools autonomously, streamlining the workflow.
- **Todo List:** When Pochi creates a to-do list for a task, it will appear here, allowing you to track progress.
- **Chat Input:** The main text area supports both text and image uploads. You can attach files by clicking the **paperclip icon** or by dragging and dropping them into the input area.
- **Bottom Toolbar:** The toolbar at the very bottom provides several key functions:
    - **Model Selector:** Choose which language model you want to interact with.
    - **Token Usage & Compact Task:** Monitor the token count of your conversation. If the conversation becomes long, a **Compact Task** button will appear, allowing you to condense the history and save tokens.
    - **Sharing:** Share your chat session with others (requires a Pochi account).
    - **Submit/Stop Button:** The send button dynamically transforms into a stop button during message generation, allowing you to interrupt the AI at any time.

## Tasks

A chat session in Pochi is saved as a **Task**. You can view your entire task history from the task list page.

Some AI-powered actions might generate a **Sub-task**, which is a new, focused chat session dedicated to a specific part of the original task.
When you're in a sub-task, you'll see a "Back" button to navigate to the parent task, allowing you to maintain context while breaking down complex problems.
By default sub-tasks are hidden in the task list.

By default, task history is stored locally. Signing in to a Pochi account enables cloud storage for your tasks, along with sharing and team collaboration features.
Be aware that clearing VS Code's extension data may erase your local task history.

## Troubleshooting

Having issues? Here are a few things to check:

- **No Active Workspace:** Pochi requires an open folder to function correctly. Make sure you have a workspace open.
- **Sign-in/Model Configuration:** Verify that you are either signed in to your Pochi account or have a valid API key configured in your `~/.pochi/config.jsonc`.
