# **TODO List**

Pochi automatically creates and manages ***TODO lists*** to help you track progress on complex tasks.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/images/core-features/todo-list/todo.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" width="60%" />
</div>

You can think of it as a shared workspace between you and Pochi. Pochi will clearly show you the step-by-step progress it plans to deliver your tasks, and the real-time progress it's making.
