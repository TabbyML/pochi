# Weekly Update #4

#### TL;DR

We are excited to introduce **Queued Messages** ‚Äî type prompts in advance and stop waiting for Pochi to finish a task! We also launched a new [**Tutorials section**](https://docs.getpochi.com/tutorials/) with guides on **voice-driven development** and **Mermaid graphs**. Have tips or insights? Contribute your own via PRs! Plus, Pochi now supports more file types, and the CLI is friendlier and more interactive. ‚ú®
