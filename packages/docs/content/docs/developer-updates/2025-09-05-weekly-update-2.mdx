# Weekly Update #2

### TL;DR

We had a massive week — **62 PRs shipped** 🎉!

Pochi can now reply to you right in **GitHub comments & issues**, the interface speaks more languages with new **i18n support**, and we rolled out a sleeker, more powerful **background job system**. On top of that, the **CLI** got smarter, **autocomplete** got friendlier, and the **docs** got a glow-up!

### Features 🚀

- **Internationalization (i18n):** The VS Code extension now supports 🇺🇸 🇨🇳 🇯🇵 🇰🇷. Want your language included? Open a PR! [#90](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/pull/90)
