# Weekly Update #22

### TL;DR

This release is a collection of small but important fixes and refinements. 

We focused on correctness, clearer UI behavior, and better visibility into what agents are actually doing, along with a couple of pieces of writing that reflect how we think about safety in production.

### 🚀 Features

- **Built-in browser subagent with live streaming:** Pochi now includes a built-in browser subagent powered by agent-browser. It runs browser automation commands through the existing execution pipeline and streams the live browser session directly in the UI, so you can see what the agent is doing as it navigates, clicks, and captures pages.**[#1107](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/1107)**

        borderRadius: "8px",
        boxShadow: "0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15)",
        }}

        Your browser does not support the video tag.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Support symlinked directories in the skill loader:** Skills can now be loaded from symlinked directories in both the CLI and VS Code extension, which makes it easier to develop skills locally by symlinking them into `.pochi/skills`. **[#1199](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/1199)**


### 📖 Resources

- **How to give coding agents access to SSH and databases without breaking production:** We published a deep dive on why common safety patterns like command allowlists, SQL filters, and approval dialogs fail with autonomous agents, and why safety must be enforced at the infrastructure and execution layer instead of through prompts or behavioral controls. **[Read blog](https://docs.getpochi.com/developer-updates/ssh-database-access/)**

- **Secure production database access in Pochi:** Following our earlier post on agent safety, we released a hands-on guide showing how to grant agents controlled database access using isolated environments and gated deployment flows, without exposing production credentials or allowing uncontrolled writes. **[Read tutorial](https://docs.getpochi.com/tutorials/secure-db-access-in-pochi/)**
