# Weekly Update #22

### TL;DR

This release we shipped a built-in browser subagent, tightened up a few rough edges, and published new writing on how we think about safety and visibility when agents interact with real systems.

### 🚀 Features

- **Built-in browser subagent with live streaming:** Pochi now includes a built-in browser subagent powered by agent-browser. It runs browser automation commands through the existing execution pipeline and streams the live browser session directly in the UI, so you can see what the agent is doing as it navigates, clicks, and captures pages. <br/> <br/> Browser sessions are persisted, allowing you to revisit screenshots or recordings after the task completes.**[#1107](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/1107)**

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Support symlinked directories in the skill loader:** Skills can now be loaded from symlinked directories in both the CLI and VS Code extension, which makes it easier to develop skills locally by symlinking them into `.pochi/skills`. **[#1199](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/1199)**


- **Fixed task forking to correctly fork subtasks:** Forking a task now also forks any subtasks created within its conversation history, instead of referencing the original task’s subtasks. This prevents broken references and ensures forked tasks are fully self-contained. **[#1134](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/1134)**

### 📖 Resources

- **How to give coding agents access to SSH and databases without breaking production:** We published a deep dive on why common safety patterns like command allowlists, SQL filters, and approval dialogs fail with autonomous agents, and why safety must be enforced at the infrastructure and execution layer instead of through prompts or behavioral controls. **[Read blog](https://docs.getpochi.com/developer-updates/ssh-database-access/)**

- **Secure production database access in Pochi:** Following our earlier post on agent safety, we released a hands-on guide showing how to grant agents controlled database access using isolated environments and gated deployment flows, without exposing production credentials or allowing uncontrolled writes. **[Read tutorial](https://docs.getpochi.com/tutorials/secure-db-access-in-pochi/)**
