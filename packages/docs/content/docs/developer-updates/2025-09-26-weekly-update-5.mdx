# Weekly Update #5

### TL;DR

This release introduces a manual sub-task execution mode for more control over sensitive workflows. Weâ€™ve also added MCP support in the CLI, enabled GitHub Copilot and Claude Pro/Max authentication, and shipped new tutorials and key security and stability improvements. ðŸ™Œ 

### ðŸš€ Features

- **Manual Execution Mode for Sub-Tasks:** Sub-tasks created with `newTask` can now be run in a manual, step-by-step mode avoiding large unmoderated changes to your codebases in your sensitive workflows. **[#300](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/300)**

- **MCP support in CLI:** The CLI now supports running your Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, allowing you to connect your tools, and run MCP-powered workflows directly from the terminal. This update brings the CLI closer to parity with the VS Code extension. **[#100](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/100)**

- **AI Tooling Integrations (GitHub Copilot + Claude):** You can now authenticate and use your GitHub Copilot and existing Claude Pro/Max subscriptions within Pochi across both the CLI and VS Code. Once authenticated, these services provide completions and suggestions directly in your workflows, enhancing the overall AI-assisted development experience. **[#184](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/184) , [#61](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/61), [#306](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/306)**

- **Improved VS Code Configuration Navigation:** VS Code commands like `Pochi: Open MCP Server Settings` now open the relevant config file and jump directly to the specific setting, **[#301](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/301)**


### âœ¨ Enhancements

- **Enhanced Gemini Model Support:** We've improved existing image input capabilities with added PDF and video inputs, providing richer multimodal workflows with Gemini models. **[#219](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/219)**

- **Malformed Custom Agents in VSCode Settings:** Previously ignored malformed agent files (e.g., with YAML parsing errors) are now displayed in the settings UI with a clear warning, making it easier to debug and fix broken custom agent configurations. **[#391](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/391)**, **[#415](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/415)**
