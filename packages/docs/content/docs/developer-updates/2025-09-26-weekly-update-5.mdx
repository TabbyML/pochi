# Weekly Update #5

#### TL;DR

This release focuses on making Pochi more powerful across environments. Weâ€™ve added MCP support in the CLI, enabled Github Copilot and Claude Pro/Max authentication, and brought powerful extensibility and completions to your workflows. 

Weâ€™ve also added a new manual sub-task execution mode, new tutorials, and key security and stability improvements. ðŸ™Œ 

#### ðŸš€ Features

- **MCP support in CLI:** The CLI now supports running your Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, allowing you to connect your tools, and run MCP-powered workflows directly from the terminal. This update brings the CLI closer to parity with the VS Code extension. **[#100](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/100)**

- **Improved VS Code Configuration Navigation:** VS Code commands like `Pochi: Open MCP Server Settings` and `Pochi: Open Custom Model Settings` now open the relevant config file and jump directly to the specific setting â€”rather than opening the file at the top. This makes it faster to configure custom models, MCP servers, and more. **[#301](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/301)**

</div>

- **GitHub Copilot Integration:** Weâ€™ve added support for authenticating GitHub Copilot and made it available via CLI and VS Code once logged in. This ensures users with active subscriptions can now use Copilot completions and suggestions inside Pochiâ€™s workflows. **[#184](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/184)**

- **Claude Pro / Max Authentication:** Weâ€™ve released support for users to connect their existing Claude Pro/Max subscriptions via OAuth for both CLI and VSCode. **[#61](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/61), [#306](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/306)**

#### âœ¨ Enhancements

- **Manual Execution Mode for Sub-Tasks:** Sub-tasks created with `newTask` can now be run in a manual, step-by-step mode avoiding large unmoderated changes to your codebases in your sensitive workflows. **[#300](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/300)**

- **Enhanced Gemini Model Support:** We've improved existing image input capabilities with added PDF and video inputs, providing richer multimodal workflows with Gemini models. **[#219](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/219)**

- **Malformed Custom Agents in VSCode Settings:** Previously ignored malformed agent files (e.g., with YAML parsing errors) are now displayed in the settings UI with a clear warning, making it easier to debug and fix broken custom agent configurations. **[#391](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/391)**, **[#415](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/415)**
