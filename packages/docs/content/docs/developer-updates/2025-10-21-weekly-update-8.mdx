# Weekly Update #8

### TL;DR

Weâ€™ve given Pochi new tricks. 

Workflows can now execute Bash commands, `readFile` tool handles multimedia inputs, and markdown rendering is faster and cleaner with `streamdown.ai`.

Letâ€™s get on with it! 


### ðŸš€ Features


- **Bash Commands in Workflows** You can now execute Bash commands directly inside Pochi workflows using the `!` prefix. This allows workflows to pull live system or repository context, like `git status` or `uname -a`, and feed the results into the model before running your task. <break></break>
For example:
 ```bash
 - With this: !`uname -a` and !`uptime` 
 - Please show the system info and uptime
 ```
 Pochi automatically runs these commands and includes their outputs in the modelâ€™s context, making workflows more dynamic and connected to your local environment. **[#541](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/541)**

### âœ¨ Enhancements


- **Faster Markdown Rendering with `streamdown.ai`:**  Weâ€™ve replaced `react-markdown` with `streamdown.ai` in the VS Code web UI. This upgrade improves performance, adds streaming-based markdown rendering, and ensures better support for rich content (like math, code blocks, and workflows). **[#401](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/401)**


- **Extended Multimedia Support in `readFile` Tool:**  The `readFile` tool now supports reading multimedia files, including images, audio, and video, for multimodal models. Pochi automatically detects file types and encodes the content in `base64` for models that can interpret visual and auditory data. **[#539](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/539)**, **[#569](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/569)**
