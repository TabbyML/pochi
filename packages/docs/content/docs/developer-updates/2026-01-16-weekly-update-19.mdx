### 📖 Resources

- We published a step-by-step guide showing how to use Git worktrees and parallel agents to run multiple tasks concurrently, with a practical weather app example that walks through setup, coordination, and best practices. [#Read more](https://docs.getpochi.com/tutorials/parallel-agent-guidance/)


### 🔥 Preview

- Along with Create Plan flow for new tasks, we’re also working on letting you choose which MCP servers and tools a task can access directly from the sidebar, instead of using a single global auto-approve toggle.

  Stay tuned!
