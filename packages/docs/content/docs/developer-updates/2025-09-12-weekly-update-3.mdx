# Weekly Update #3

### TL;DR

This week we brought **custom agents** to life!üê£ Pochi **CLI is on npm**, `newTask` makes it simple to create and manage tasks right from the terminal, and Mermaid diagrams render beautifully inside the app. MCP interactions are smarter too, and the docs and UI keep getting smoother with every update. ‚ú®

### Features üöÄ

- **`newTask` in CLI:** Spin up tasks directly from the terminal, each with its dedicated agent. [#232](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/pull/232)
