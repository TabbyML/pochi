# Weekly Update #7

### TL;DR

This week, we focused on making Pochi more capable for builders who live in the terminal.¬†We extended image-prompt support to the CLI, added global workflows for shared automations, and made the command-line experience smoother with shell autocompletion.

We‚Äôve also shipped `.pochiignore` support and small but delightful touches like copying images directly from the extension chat.

### üöÄ Features


- **CLI Autocompletion:** The Pochi CLI now supports shell autocompletion for `bash`, `zsh`, and `fish`.¬†Improve your flow as you discover commands, subcommands and options while typing, without the need to stop and check docs mid-flow. **[#307](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/307)**

    }}

</div>

- **Global Workflows:** You can now store workflows globally in `~/.pochi/workflows`, and Pochi will load them across all workspaces. Easily share automations, setups, or linting rules, while allowing your team to maintain consistent review or deployment routines.**[#123](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/123)**, **[#517](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/517)**


- **Image Prompts in CLI:** You can pass images directly to Pochi from the CLI, be it a diagram, a UI screenshot, or a flow chart. Models interpret and respond to your visuals, explaining issues, parsing charts and generating code based on UI mockups. **[#513](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/513)**


### ‚ú® Enhancements

- **`.pochiignore` Support:** You can now use `.pochiignore` (just like `.gitignore`) to exclude files and directories from Pochi‚Äôs context, keeping your large repositories lean and your prompts focused on the task at hand. **[#515](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/515)** , **[#516](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/516)**<break></break>

```bash
# Example .pochiignore
node_modules/
dist/
*.log
```


- **Copy Images from MCP and Attachments:** You can now right-click any image generated by MCP tools or shared in chat to copy it to your clipboard or open it in an editor tab. A small addition, but a big win for anyone working with visual data or model-generated diagrams. **[#500](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/500)**

### üêõ Bug fixes

- **Command Queue Stability:** Fixed race conditions between queued and other requests (particularly during preview operations) to improve execution consistency and error handling. **[#528](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/issues/528)**
