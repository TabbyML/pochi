# Voice-Driven Development with Handy and Pochi

This tutorial guides you through setting up an efficient, voice-driven development workflow by combining two powerful tools: **[Handy](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy)** for local voice transcription and **[Pochi](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi)** as your AI coding assistant.

This setup allows you to speak commands, have them transcribed into text by Handy, and then have Pochi execute those commands, creating a seamless, hands-free coding experience that keeps your audio on-device.

### What You Will Learn
- How to install and configure Handy for offline voice-to-text transcription.
- How to integrate Handy with Pochi to create a voice-driven development workflow.
- Tips for optimizing your setup for accuracy and efficiency.

### Prerequisites
- **Pochi**: You should have Pochi installed and running in your editor.
- **Handy**: Downloadable for macOS, Windows, and Linux from the official releases page.
- **Microphone and accessibility permissions**: Handy needs access to your microphone and the ability to paste text into other applications.

### How It Works

- **Handy** listens to your voice and converts it into text using on-device transcription models (Whisper or Parakeet).
- **Pochi** takes the text generated by Handy as a command and processes it using its configured AI model.

> **For a Fully Private Workflow**
> This tutorial focuses on the voice input aspect. For complete privacy and offline use, you can configure Pochi to use a local Large Language Model (LLM). See Pochi's documentation on [model configuration](../../models) for more details.

## Step 1: Install and Configure Handy

Handy is a cross-platform desktop application built with Tauri that records your voice via a keyboard shortcut and pastes the transcribed text into any application.

1. **Download Handy**: Get the latest version from the [official releases page](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/releases) or the project website [handy.computer](https://handy.computer).

2. **Install and Grant Permissions**:
   - **macOS**: Open the downloaded `.dmg`, drag Handy into your `Applications` folder, and launch it once. Grant **Microphone** and **Accessibility** permissions when prompted so Handy can record audio and paste text.
   - **Windows**: Run the installer, then allow Handy to access the microphone. You may need to approve the accessibility overlay so Handy can send keystrokes.
   - **Linux**: Make the AppImage executable (e.g., `chmod +x Handy-x86_64.AppImage`), run it, and approve microphone/input permissions as required by your desktop environment.

3. **Configure Handy Settings**:

   **A. Set Your Hotkey**
   Choose a shortcut that does not conflict with other apps. Handy supports both push-to-talk and toggle behaviors. Enable `Push to Talk` if you want to hold the shortcut while speaking; otherwise, use the default press-to-start, press-again-to-stop mode.

   **B. Select Your Transcription Engine**
   Handy can run multiple local transcription models:
   - **Whisper models (Small/Medium/Turbo/Large)** for GPU-accelerated accuracy on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
   - **Parakeet V3** for fast CPU-only transcription with automatic language detection.

   **C. Download Your Model**

   The first time you pick a model, Handy downloads and optimizes it. This may take several minutes and will temporarily increase CPU usage.

   **D. Customize Output Behavior**
   Tune options such as automatic text pasting, capitalization, and whether Handy should clear or append text after each recording.

## Step 2: The Voice Coding Workflow in Action

With Handy installed, let's try the workflow.

1. **Open Pochi**: Launch Pochi's chat interface in your code editor.
2. **Activate Handy**: Click inside Pochi's input box, then use the shortcut you configured for Handy. Handy shows an on-screen indicator when it is listening.

3. **Speak Your Command**: Clearly state the task you want Pochi to perform. For example:

   > Write a TypeScript function that takes an array of strings and returns the longest one.
4. **Transcription**: When you stop recording, Handy transcribes your speech and pastes the text into Pochi's input box (or copies it to the clipboard, depending on your settings).
5. **Execution**: Pochi sends the text to its configured AI model for processing. The generated code or response appears in the chat.

## Tips and Troubleshooting

- **Inaccurate Transcription?**
  Try switching to a larger Whisper model or to Parakeet V3 for improved accuracy on CPU-only systems.

- **Performance Concerns?**
  Smaller Whisper models consume fewer resources. If latency is high, choose a smaller model or use Parakeet V3.

- **Need Help with Handy?**
  Open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues).

## Conclusion

By combining Handy and Pochi, you've created a fast and efficient voice-powered programming environment. This setup gives you a modern, hands-free way to translate your ideas into code while keeping the entire transcription pipeline on your device.
