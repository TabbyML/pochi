## Installation

Install the Pochi extension from the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabbyML.pochi) or [OpenVSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/TabbyML/pochi).

We recommend dragging Pochi to the right side of your VSCode window to get the best experience.

With Pochi, you can use any LLM provider by configuring their API keys. Use the VS Code command `Pochi: Open Custom Model Settings` to open the settings file and [configure it](./models). Alternatively, Pochi offers cloud-based services. Creating a Pochi account gives you access to:

- Pochi's managed LLM models
- Shared task histories and team management
- Integrations with GitHub and Slack for a collaborative workflow

To use these features, sign up at [app.getpochi.com](http://app.getpochi.com) and log in to your VS Code extension.

## Customize

You can tailor Pochi to your needs by editing its configuration file, located at `~/.pochi/config.jsonc`. The file uses the JSONC (JSON with Comments) format, so you can add notes to explain your settings.

```jsonc
{
  // The schema enables autocompletion and validation in your code editor.
  "$schema": "https://getpochi.com/config.schema.json",

  // For details on available options, see the "Models," "Rules," pages in the sidebar
  // ...
}
```
