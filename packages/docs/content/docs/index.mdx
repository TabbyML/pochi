# Welcome

Welcome to the **_Pochi docs_** - your comprehensive guide to using your Full-Stack AI Teammate. Here you'll find resources to help you get started, maximize productivity, and build amazing applications with state-of-the-art AI capabilities.

# What is Pochi?

Pochi is an AI agent designed for software development. It operates within your IDE, using a toolkit of commands to execute complex tasks, from code generation to project-wide refactoring.

Pochi's workflow is built on these principles:

- **Agent-Based Workflow**: You assign a task, and Pochi works autonomously to complete it. It can read files, execute commands, and apply changes to your codebase.
- **Flexible & Extensible**: Pochi's functionality is centered around a **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** model. This allows you to connect any supported LLM provider, giving you full control over the agent's "brain," your data privacy, and operational costs. No account is required to use the BYOK model.
- **Cloud Services**: For teams that need collaborative features, we offer account-based services like shared task list, group billing. These services are optional and build upon the core functionality.

## Community & Support

**Interested in contributing or just engaging with the team?** We welcome your input through our [Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/tWF66yr8NQ)\! Feel free to share feedback, report bugs, and suggest features there\!
