# **Agent Toolset & Cloud Integrations**

Pochi's capabilities are divided into its core agent toolset and optional cloud integrations.

## **Core Agent Toolset**

The Pochi agent comes equipped with a set of built-in tools that allow it to interact with your local development environment. These tools are fundamental to its operation and are available by default, regardless of whether you have an account.

Key tools include:
- **File System Access**: Read, write, and modify files.
- **Command Execution**: Run shell commands and scripts.
- **Code Search**: Perform regex-based searches across your codebase.

These tools enable the agent to perform complex, multi-step tasks like refactoring code, adding features, and fixing bugs autonomously. You can review the full list of available tools in the Pochi extension settings.

## **Cloud Integrations**

For teams and developers who need collaborative features, we offer optional cloud-based integrations. These require a Pochi account and connect the agent to external services.

### **GitHub**

Connecting your GitHub account allows the agent to:
- Clone repositories and understand their full context.
- Create and review pull requests.
- Track and manage issues.
- Handle branch management and resolve merge conflicts.

### **Slack**

Our Slack integration is currently experimental. The goal is to enable seamless collaboration by allowing you to:
- Assign tasks to the Pochi agent directly from Slack channels.
- Receive real-time progress updates in conversation threads.
