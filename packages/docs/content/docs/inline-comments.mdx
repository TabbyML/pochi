# Inline Comments

Inline Comments let you leave feedback directly on the code generated by Pochi inside VS Code. Instead of re-explaining issues in chat, you can comment on specific lines in the diff, batch those comments, and send them back to Pochi for the right contextual fixes.

This feature is not your regular PR review system. It’s actual conversations with the LLM, attached to the code they refer to.

## How to Use Inline Comments

### 1. Run a Prompt
Generate code or request changes like normal.

```bash
/pochi please use mermaidchart instead of Vega Lite
```

### 2. Open the Diff
Once Pochi applies changes, open the diff view in VS Code:

* Hover over a code line
* Click `+` to add a comment

### 3. Leave Feedback
Type your comment directly on the line where the issue exists.

### 4. Add Multiple Comments
Leave comments across the file as needed. Each comment is automatically linked to its exact line + file path.

### 5. Send Comments as a Batch
Once ready:
* Click `Submit Reviews` to Pochi
* Or run the command: 
  ```bash
  /pochi please review the comments
  ```

Pochi will revise all requested changes in one pass.
