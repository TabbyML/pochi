# Workflows

Workflows are step-by-step automation templates that guide Pochi through complex, multi-step processes. Think of them as detailed recipes that Pochi can follow to complete common development tasks consistently and efficiently.

### Configure

Workflows shall be put inside `.pochi/workflows/` directory in your workspace root. Each workflow is a markdown file with a specific name.

`.pochi/workflows/create-pr.md` is an example we used in Pochi's own development.

```markdown
Please help create a PR for the current staging changes, following these guidelines:
- If there are no staging changes but there are uncommitted changes, please stage them first.
- Create a branch name based on the current git diff status.
- Write a meaningful commit message/PR title.
- Use the gh CLI to create a PR.
- When running the push operation, it might be aborted due to a husky pre-push hook. For formatting issues, amend the files and try again. For other issues, try to resolve them as much as possible.
- The base branch for the PR should always be `main`.
- Always push the branch to the remote repository before creating the PR.

When creating PR with markdown description, pay attention to escape backticks, otherwise it will be executed as command substitution in the shell.
```

### Usage

Once your workflows are set up, using them is straightforward:
1. **Type `/` in VS Code** to trigger the Pochi workflow selector
2. **Select a workflow** from the dropdown menu and press `Enter`.
3. You can attached additional context when running the workflow, e.g `/create-pr assign Meng for review after creation`.
