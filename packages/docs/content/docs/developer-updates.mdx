### TL;DR

We had a massive week — **62 PRs shipped** 🎉!

Pochi can now reply to you right in **GitHub comments & issues**, the interface speaks more languages with new **i18n support**, and we rolled out a sleeker, more powerful **background job system**. On top of that, the **CLI** got smarter, **autocomplete** got friendlier, and the **docs** got a glow-up!

### Features 🚀

- **GitHub Action integration:** Pochi now lives in your PR comments / issues! Ask for help in a PR with `/pochi`. [#76](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/pull/76)
- **Internationalization (i18n):** The VS Code extension now supports 🇺🇸 🇨🇳 🇯🇵 🇰🇷. Want your language included? Open a PR! [#90](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/pull/90)

### Enhancements ✨

  - Trigger workflows directly with `pochi -p "/create-pr"` [#110](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/pull/110)

### Bug Fixes 🐛

- **File writing reliability:** The CLI ensures directories exist before writing, so `writeToFile` tool won't fail. [#118](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/pull/118)
