### TL;DR

We had a massive week ‚Äî **62 PRs shipped** üéâ!

Pochi can now reply to you right in **GitHub comments**, the interface speaks more languages with new **i18n support**, and we rolled out a sleeker, more powerful **background job system**. On top of that, the **CLI** got smarter, **autocomplete** got friendlier, and the **docs** got a glow-up!

### Features üöÄ

- **GitHub Action integration:** Pochi now lives in your PR comments! Ask for help in a PR with `/pochi`. [#76](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/pull/76)
- **Internationalization (i18n):** The VS Code extension now supports üá∫üá∏ üá®üá≥ üáØüáµ üá∞üá∑. Want your language included? Open a PR! [#90](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/pull/90)

- **CLI workflow support:** Trigger a workflow directly from the CLI with `pochi -p "/create-pr"`. [#110](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/pull/110)
- **Autocomplete:** Pochi suggests relevant tools, functions, and variables to help you type prompts faster. [#89](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/pull/89)
- **BYOK models configuration is easier:** `maxTokens` and `contextWindow` are made optional. [#104](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/pull/104)

### Bug Fixes üêõ

- **CLI workflow fallback:** Missing workflows now trigger a warning instead of an error, allowing the CLI to continue execution. [#122](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/pull/122)
- **File writing reliability:** The CLI will ensure directories exist before writing, so file operations won't fail. [#118](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi/pull/118)
