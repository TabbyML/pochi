# **Usage**

Pochi's architecture is designed for flexibility, giving you two primary ways to manage your LLM usage and costs: the **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** model and our **Managed Service**.

## **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)**

This is the default and recommended model for most developers. It provides maximum control and transparency.

- **Cost**: Pochi itself is free to use with this model. You are only responsible for the token costs charged by your selected LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
- **Providers**: You can connect any supported LLM by providing your API key in the extension settings.
- **Billing**: Your LLM provider will bill you directly. Pochi does not add any fees.
- **Benefits**: Full control over model selection, spending, and data privacy. Ideal for developers with existing API subscriptions or those who want to manage their own stack.

## **Managed Service (Optional)**

For users who prefer a simplified setup or want access to our curated model offerings, we provide an optional managed service. This requires a Pochi account.

- **Cost**: Usage is billed through Pochi on a pay-as-you-go basis. We pass through the direct token costs from the LLM providers, plus a small service fee to cover operational expenses.
- **Models**: The managed service includes access to a range of models, categorized by performance and cost.
- **Billing**: We use Stripe for secure payment processing. Upon signing up, you receive a monthly allocation of free credits. After the credits are used, billing occurs based on your token consumption. You can set a monthly spending limit in your profile to control costs.
