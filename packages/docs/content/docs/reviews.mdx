# Reviews

Reviews let you give line-level feedback to Pochi in two ways.

## 1. Reviews as Inline Comments

Inline comments let you leave feedback directly on generated code inside VS Code. Instead of re-explaining issues in chat, you can comment on specific lines in the diff, batch those comments, and send them back to Pochi for the right contextual fixes.

This is not your regular PR review system. It’s actual conversations with the LLM, attached to the code they refer to.

## How to Use Inline Comments in Reviews

### 1. Run a Prompt
Generate code or request changes like normal.

```bash
Please use Mermaid Chart instead of Vega Lite
```

### 2. Open the Diff
Once Pochi applies changes, open the diff view in VS Code:

In the diff, hover over a code line and click `+` to add a comment

### 3. Leave Feedback
Type your comment directly on the line where the issue exists.

### 4. Add Multiple Comments
Leave comments across the file as needed. Each comment is automatically linked to its exact line + file path.

### 5. Send Comments as a Batch

Once you’re done adding comments, submit them just like you would for any other review.

Click `Submit Reviews` to Pochi to send all line-level comments as a batch.

This works the same way as submitting a review with empty messages, where the comments themselves are the request.

If you want to add extra instructions or context, you can type an additional message in the chat box before submitting.

For example:

```bash
Please review the feedback
```

or with extra guidance:

```bash
Apply these comments and also rename the handler for consistency
```

Pochi will process every line comment with context and update the code accordingly.

## 2. Reviews as Edits (User Edits)

Edits account for changes you make locally while iterating on the code.

If you fix something yourself, tweak a variable, or partially rewrite a block before asking for help, Pochi captures those recent edits and includes them as part of the review context.

Instead of only seeing the final file state, the agent receives the exact diffs you introduced, which helps it reason about what changed, where it changed, and what you were likely trying to adjust.

This gives the agent a clearer signal of your current intent and what should be addressed next.

## How Edits Are Used

### 1. Make your changes 

You can open the diff from the last response and make direct changes to the written code.

All local changes you make gets reflected in the chatbox UI.

### 2. Send Edits as a Batch

Once you’re done making changes, submit your next prompt as usual.

Pochi will include your recent edits together with your message and use them as structured context for the next step.

This lets the agent build directly on top of what you already adjusted, without you needing to re-explain those changes in chat.
