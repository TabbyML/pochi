# Plan: Improve CLI Help Messages

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines a plan to improve the command-line interface (CLI) messages for `pochi`, with an initial focus on error messages. Based on exploration, the current messages can be unclear for new users. The primary goal is to enhance clarity, ensuring users can quickly understand what went wrong.

## 2. Goals

*   **Improve Clarity:** Refine error messages to be more understandable for new users.
*   **Maintain Tone:** Ensure all messages are concise and technical, consistent with a developer tool.
*   **Focus on Errors:** Prioritize the improvement of error messages before addressing other help outputs.

## 3. User Stories

*   **As a new user,** when I enter an incorrect command or argument, **I want to see a clear error message** so that I can understand my mistake and correct it without confusion.
*   **As a new user,** when something goes wrong, **I want a concise explanation of the problem** so I can quickly diagnose the issue.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  All error messages in the CLI must be reviewed and, where necessary, rewritten for clarity.
2.  Each error message must clearly and accurately describe the error that occurred.
3.  The language used must be concise and technical, avoiding ambiguity.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

*   Providing suggested fixes or commands within error messages in this iteration.
*   Adding links to external documentation.
*   A comprehensive overhaul of the general help messages (`pochi --help`) or subcommand help messages.
*   Implementing friendly or verbose explanatory text.
*   Significant changes to the visual formatting or color-coding of CLI output.

## 6. Design Considerations (Optional)

N/A

## 7. Technical Considerations

*   The project uses the `commander` library for its CLI.
*   The main CLI configuration is in `packages/cli/src/cli.ts`.
*   Error message customization will involve modifying the `commander` configuration, specifically by using `.configureOutput()` to provide more descriptive error messages.

## 8. Success Metrics

*   A qualitative review demonstrates that the revised error messages are significantly clearer than the previous versions.
