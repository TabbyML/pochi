It is a stateful, multi-turn interactive problem. A day-to-day involves much more than just writing the correct functions. You often need to navigate a file system, check up on dependency graphs, run the proper tests, and interpret logs in case of errors.

That means it is difficult to indentify which step really contributed to the final success of the model and which step should get the reward.

Engineers generally do not just read code as text but also think about the execution loops in their mind.
